3.1 ex - testing installer features for Plone 3.2

    - When building Python on Darwin, don't do setpgrp patch if
      MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is set for Tiger.

    - Switch to a single .py script for instance creation.

    - Create init plone site and content via plonectl (plone.recipe.unifiedinstaller)
      Remove mkPloneSite.py from this kit.

    - Set up root-install cluster to run ZEO and clients under separate
      user ids. Don't allow clients access to filestorage.

    - Unified control program "plonectl"
    
    - Replace Zope root page with a Plone-specific page
    
    - Install paster/ZopeSkel under the control of buildout
    
    - Optional build of readline, mainly needed for Leopard
    
    - --separate-zope, --skip-tool-tests, --log options, mainly
      useful for building the OS X installer.
    
    - Heavily commented buildout.cfgs with most major options set
      in variables at the top
      
    - buildout.cfg with commented out common products
    
    - Now installs to /usr/local/Plone rather than /opt/Plone-version.
      Uses /Applications/Plone on Darwin.

3.1.4

    - Update to Plone 3.1.4 release.

3.1.3

    - Update to Plone 3.1.3 release.

3.1.2

    - Update to Python 2.4.5, now officially supported by Zope 2.10.6.

    - Update to Plone 3.1.1 release.

    - Add --separate-zope command-line option to build/use
      a Zope outside of the buildout parts.

3.1.1

    - Update to Plone 3.1.1 release.

3.1
    - Update to Plone 3.1 release.

	- Changed the zeo template buildout.cfg clients to use
	  ${zeoserver:zeo-address} rather than literals so that
	  the zeoserver address is only in one spot.

    - Added option to skip running bin/buildout. Use --nobuildout flag.

    - Added documentation on building under OpenBSD.

    - Fixed a bug in the code that tries to find Python.h. This
      would have blocked attempts to build PIL for existing Pythons.

    - Add code to make install.sh work with tar variations that
      don't support bzip2 and/org gunzip. Now requires bunzip2
      and gunzip.

    - Change version numbering to match Plone; advance to 3.1-rc1.

3.1.0-beta1

    - Change version numbering to match Plone; advance to 3.1-beta1.

Beta 5

    - If using --with-python and _imaging isn't available, see
      if the headers to build it are available before giving
      up.

    - Set umask to 022 early in install.

    - Add cxx flag to python configure for global libs code branch.

Beta 4

    - Minor change in end-of-install message to accommodate

    - Update to Plone 3.0.6, ZopeSkel 1.5.1.

    - Allow target command-line argument to be a relative path
      (thanks, Raphael Ritz).

Beta 2

    - Default to "newest=false" in buildout.cfg.

    - Direct most of build noise to a detailed log file in hopes that 
      real errors will get noticed.
