  Fixes #88.
  [smcmahon]

5.2rc1-r1 (installer revision) (unreleased)

- Remove DocFinderTab from develop.cfg.
  It's not Python-3 compatible.
  [smcmahon]

- Bypass libz, libssl and libxml tool tests if we don't need to build a Python.
  Since we are no longer necessarily building Pillow and lxml (optimistically assuming availability of binary eggs for popular platforms), we no longer need to check for headers in advance.
  [smcmahon]

5.2rc1 2019-03-13

- Update docs to highlight --with-python option to designate desired Python.
  [smcmahon]

- Update docs to note that the installer no longer runs offline.
  [smcmahon]

- Update to 5.2rc1.
  [smcmahon]

- Remove pre-built buildout cache.
  With a need to support multiple Pythons, the pre-cooked eggs were no longer practical.
  Tests indicated that providing an uncooked source cache provided no significant build performance over download/build with good connections.
  [smcmahon]

5.2b1 (unreleased)

- Python 3 compatability for build and support scripts.
  [smcmahon]

- Change cache strategy to avoid pre-cooked eggs, which are Python-version independent.
  [smcmahon]

- Change Plone/Zope version.cfg strategy to avoid name collisions, follow relative URLs.
  [smcmahon]

- change where to get help to our forum
  [tkimnguyen]

5.1.5 2019-01-08

- Update to Plone 5.1.5.
  [smcmahon]

5.1.4r1 2018-11-10

- The precompiler and command recipes were missing from the buildout cache. Fixed.
  [smcmahon]

5.1.4 2018-10-11

- Update to Plone 5.1.4.
  [smcmahon]

(5.1.3 was never released)

- Now works with Windows 10.
  See docs/windows.rst.
  [smcmahon]

- Updates for new setuptools seem to be complete, so we're dropping install of a custom setuptools.
  Update to virtualenv-16.0.0, zc.buildout-2.12.1.
  [smcmahon]

- repozo script source was incorrect in [repozo], resulting in repozo script not being build in standalone installs.
  [smcmahon]

5.1.2 2018-05-09

- Update to Plone 5.1.2.
  [smcmahon]

5.1.1 2018-04-09

- Updated zc.buildout 2.11.2 and to virtualenv-15.2.0.
  The new zc.buildout resolved its own problem with setuptools, but problems remained in other packages, notably plone.recipe.zope2instance.
  So, we're still installing our own setuptools.
  [smcmahon]

- Update to Plone 5.1.1.
  [smcmahon]

5.1.0r2 2018-03-18

- The version of setuptools contained in virtualenv-15.1.01 (setuptools 38.8.1) is not compatible with zc.buildout-2.11.1, producing an error "AttributeError: ‘module’ object has no attribute ‘SetuptoolsVersion’" while running buildout.
  Since we want the new zc.buildout for wheel-ability and the setuptools in the previous version of virtualenv is too old for it, we need to install a setuptools version (38.7.0).
  Fixes #71. Thanks, ronchi.
  [smcmahon]

5.1.0r1 2018-03-06

- For good reason, a recent change in sudo does not allow overwriting PWD.
  That fouled up the installer's scheme for keeping track of the installer directory, causing helper scripts to be lost.
  Fixed.
  [smcmahon]

- Packages included with the first 5.1.0 installer did not include some recipes used when installing via sudo.
  [smcmahon]

5.1.0 2018-03-02

- Update virtualenv to 13.0.1. Suppress misleading pip messages.

- Install would fail if installing sudo in an environment where
  it doesn't know how to created users/groups -- even if users and
  group existed. Fixes #32.

5.0b2-r1 - 2015-05-26

- precompiler was missing from packages. Fixed.

5.0b2 - 2015-05-23

- Update virtualenv to 13.0.1.

- Remove "-pending"

- Eliminate bootstrap.py; install zc.buildout via pip in

  https://community.plone.org/t/not-using-bootstrap-py-as-default/620

- Change virtualenv strategy. Install inside the instance rather
  than base directory.

- Update links in README.

- Fix jpeg missing message. Closes #28.

- Update to 5.0b2-pending.

5.0b1
==================

- Change root-method install default target from /usr/local/Plone
  to /opt/plone. This is principally to work around a bug in the
  patched Python 2.7.x in some versions of debian/ubuntu which
  sabotage Python installs under /usr/local for recent versions
  of setuptools.

- Update to use recent setuptools.

- Remove facilities to build readline and jpeg libraries. We really
  wish to discourage any local libraries.

- Replace zopeskel with mr.bob.

- Adapt to Plone 5.0b1

5.0a2 - 2014-04-29
==================

- Adapt to 5.0a2

- Consolidate all the version files to one. Is this a good idea?

NOTE: The 5.0a# series installers are basically the 4.3.x installer. The
final 5.0 installer will likely have many changes.

4.3.3 - 2014-04-17
==================

- Set the magic flags for C-language component builds under XCode 5.1+.

- Adapt to 4.3.3.

- Use newest version of Pillow; adapt jpeg_decoder tests for it.

- Return setuptools to 0.7.2 for fuller buildout compatability. Use
  --no-setuptools with virtualenv (updated). Adapt to distribute no
  longer being in use.

- Update bootstrap.py to v 2, update zc.buildout to 2.2.1, setuptools to 2.2.

4.3.3-pending - 2014-02-24
==========================

- Adapt to 4.3.3-pending.
  [pauloxnet, merged by smcmahon with permission from esteele.
   only changes were version #s and license file.]

4.3.2 - 2013-09-11
==================

- Adapt to 4.3.2.

- All hail setuptools >= 7! Adapt to the new era.

- Update to Python 2.7.5.

4.3.1 - r1 - 2013-06-19
=======================

- Incorporate Hotfix R3.

- Add tests/vb_tests, a kit to test the installer in multiple vagrant
  boxes.

4.3.1 - 2013-06-19
==================

- Adapt to 4.3.1, add hotfix.

- Restore --without-ssl option that may be used to bypass ssl tests.
  Whatever hard ssl dependency arose in 4.2.x, it's gone now.

- Patch z3c.recipe.staticlxml to work with SUSE lib64 build paths.

- Update to jpeg-9

- Update distribute to 0.6.36.

- Incorporate 2013-05-02 snapshot of master branch of z3c.recipe.staticlxml
  plus amd64 fix.

- Use --distribute when building virtualenv.

- Lots of documentation improvements.

- Python 2.7.x is now downloaded if needed and requested. This reduces
  the tarball 11M. If a user cannot download the Python tarball on the
  destination machine, they can download elsewhere and copy into the
  packages directory.

- We have had multiple reports of users who have tried to use the --user
  flag to set the Zope startup user. Changed to --daemon-user to clarify
  its purpose. Clarified README.txt. Related to #13545.

- In a sudo install, if one of the plone_* users (or specified on command
  line) already existed and had something other than plone_group for its
  default group, install would abort. Modified permissions strategy to
  tolerate users with plone_group in extra groups by using setgroup bit.
  Modified user creation strategy to add plone_group if user already
  exists. Resolves #13545.

- Attempting sudo install from a path that is not world-readable would
  prevent the drop-permission part of the install from reaching
  needed resources. Fixed by copying needed resources to a temp
  directory inside the install target. Resolves #13523.

- Add provision for passing environment via sudo. Add docs. Should resolve
  #13537.

4.3 - 2013-04-14
================

- Adapt to 4.3.

- Add note on installer directory permissions in sudo installs.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/13523.

- Move zopeskel to develop.cfg.

- Add zest.releaser to develop.cfg.

- Remove omelette. Since all the eggs for an installer build are in
  the buildout cache, it's not as useful as when they may be spread
  over the file system. It also doesn't work in environments that
  don't support symbolic links.

- Add Diazo command-line tools to develop.cfg.

- Suppress meaningless warnings on chmod in set permissions.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/ticket/13488.

- On BSD systems, group will not be set automatically to plone_group
  unless directory is set that way. Affects sudo installs. Fixed.

4.3rc1 - (installer release 2, 2013-03-13)
==========================================

- zeoserver address reference was missing from zeo client buildout
  sections created by the installer. Fixes #13482.

4.3rc1 - 2013-03-11
===================

- Adapt to 4.3rc1.

- Add version specs for plone.recipe.precompiler and
  plone.recipe.command.

4.3b3 (installer release 3, 2012-01-30)
=======================================

- Apply lxml underlink fix to all systems where ld accepts --no-as-needed.

4.3b2 (installer release 2, 2013-01-27)
=======================================

- Use plone.recipe.unifiedinstaller 4.3.1 to incorporate fix for
  plonectl.

- The version check logic for libxml2/libxslt did not work on
  shells that limit return values to a byte. Fixed.

4.3b2 - 2012-01-23
==================

- Adapt to 4.3b2

- Include a dev copy of z3c.recipe.staticlxml that cures clock_gettime
  underlink on some gcc 4.[56] systems.

- if libjpeg is needed, make sure it's built even when using a virtualenv
  python. Cures a problem on OS X.

- Fix Ticket #13406, Installer fails after building python, by
  removing bad zlib test.

4.3b1 2013-01-04
==================

- Adapt to 4.3b1.

- Adapt to 4.3b1-pending.

- Add sanity check for lxml and PIL via zopepy.

- Prefer system python and packages whenever they exist and
  are acceptable. Only build python or xml2/xslt when explicitly
  requested.

- On server mode installs, isolate the daemon a bit more by having
  it run as a user distinct from the one owning the rest of the
  buildout.

- On server mode installs, run buildout as the buildout user rather
  than root.

- Loosen the coupling between install.sh and create_instance.py by
  using getopts style command-line arguments.

4.2.2 - update 2012-11-09
=========================

- Incorporate Products.PloneHotfix20121106 == 1.2

4.2.2 - update 2012-10-24
=========================

- Step back to libxml2 2.8.0. 2.9.0 won't build on OS X.

4.2.2 - 2012-10-23
==================

- libxml2/libxslt has finally been updated to cover CVE-2011-3919.
  Updated libxml2 & libxslt version specs and removed dev version
  of z3c.recipe.staticlxml.

- Update readme to point to install and maintain section
  of collective dev man.

- Allow Python 2.6.x or 2.7.x. Resolves #13265.

- Add automatic log rotation for clients. Resolves #13184.

- Adapt to Plone 4.2.2. Update libjpeg, distribute and virtualenv.

4.2.1
=====

- Update Plone to 4.2.1.

4.2 installer update - 2012-07-08
=================================

- Remove osxcontroller support. This only worked on OS X 10.5 & 10.6, which
  have been out-of-date for over a year.

4.2 - 2012-07-02
================

- Adapt to 4.2.

- --without-lxml is no longer supported, as lxml is required. Option removed.

4.2rc2 - 2012-06-06
===================

- Adapt to 4.2rc2

4.2rc1 - 2012-05-15
===================

- Adapt to 4.2rc1.

- Update Python to 2.7.3. Set PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to "random".

- Include an unreleased version of z3c.recipe.staticlxml that applies a patch
  for CVE-2011-3919. XXX: This should be replaced or removed when unnecessary.

4.2b2 - 2012-02-15
==================

- Stop bundling zlib/libz. This is a required library on nearly every
  platform.

- Adapt to use Python 2.7.x.

- if --with-python is used, there is no need to check for ssl libraries.

4.2b1 - unreleased
==================

- Adapt to 4.2b1. 4.1 is now a maintenance branch, 4.2 the master.

4.1.3 - 2011-12-06
==================

- preflight tool tests were not being skipped when --skip-tool-tests flag
  was set. This caused the OS X binary installer to fail if gcc was missing.

- Check for availability of patch program. Fixes #12408.

4.1.3 - 2011-12-01
==================

- Update to 4.1.3.

- Allow easy specification of environment variables.

- Move the version-specific dist specification to the editable section.

- Add packages/ patch files (but not binaries) to git repo to make sure
  they're tracked.

- If sslv2 is not available, apply patch to remove the requirement from
  the Python build. Fixes problems with python ssl support build on
  platforms like Ubuntu 11.10 where sslv2 is disabled.
  Thanks to oggers for researching this.

- Don't install OSX controller on Lion (no wx).

4.1.2
=====

- Update to 4.1.2

- Try to detect libxml2/libxslt if installed; check versions. Only build
  statically if missing or out-of-date.

- 4.1 requires ssl (optional with earlier versions). Make it much clearer
  that this is required. Fixes #12248.

- Refine some of the dependency tests.

- Earlier debian multiarch detection code would fail if multiple multiarch
  directories were present. Fixed, thanks to jgrigera for the solution.
  issue #12188

4.1 - 2011-09-07
================

- Fixes for building on Fedora 15, issue #12103. Removed some configure
  options that only worked with Python 2.4.x. I don't know why they
  only caused problems with Fedora 15.

4.1 - 2011-08-30
================

- Add --clients=# option to specify # of zeo clients created.

- Add --with-site-packages option to use virtualenv without the
  extra isolation.

- Provide more options to control lxml install.

4.1 - 2011-07-26
================

- Adapt to work with OS X 10.7. This mainly involved updating readline
  and libjpeg to most-current versions.

4.1
===

- Update to 4.1

4.1rc3 + Zope-Hotfix-2011-06-22
===============================

- Fixes to lxml build for root installs. Separate lxml build.

4.1rc3
======

- Add patch for Natty's multiarch. Fixes problem with inability to build
  Python zlib support when libraries are in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu.

- Switched from PIL to Pillow>=1.7.1, as it has support for the nutty
  natty multiarch paths.

4.1rc2
======
