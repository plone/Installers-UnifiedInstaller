  Thanks to Steve McMahon for submitting.


0.8 (2011-08-12)
================

- Updated default libxml/libxslt download locations to
  http://xmlsoft.org/sources/libxml2-2.7.8.tar.gz and
  http://xmlsoft.org/sources/libxslt-1.1.26.tar.gz respectively. Those updated
  versions fix a Lion compile issue as reported by jladage.

- Using Python's ``doctest`` module instead of depreacted
  ``zope.testing.doctest``.


0.7.2 (2010-08-13)
==================

- Made smoke test a bit more fuzzy to ignore output differences when newer
  zc.recipe.cmmi versions are used or tests are running on Mac OS X.

- Fixed "relocation R_x86_64_32" error on 64 bit linux by using --with-pic as
  extra option to the libxml/libxslt build.  [reinout]

0.7.1 (2009-05-18)
==================

- Removed accidentally checked in pdb [wosc]
- Updated our use of zc.recipe.cmmi, which from 1.2.0 on *requires* the URL to
  be known on construction time. (The new usage is backward-compatible with
  1.1.x). [wosc]

0.7 (2009-05-18)
================

- Passing include-dirs, library-dirs and rpath newline separated as required
  by zc.recipe.egg. This fixes non static build on linux.  [zagy]
- Consult buildout's [version] section for the libxml2/libxslt-URLs [wosc]

0.6 (2009-03-19)
================

- Switching off building of the exslt crypt functionality. That crypt
  functionality isn't found anymore on exslt.org itself. And it uses
  libgcrypt, which somehow leads to runtime errors regarding 'gcry_*' on osx
  and sometimes on linux.  [reinout]

0.5 (2009-03-16)
================

- The recipe checks for an existing egg before doing expensive
  download/compiles. Previously, the check was implicitly done *after*
  compiling libmxl/libxslt. The egg name is printed with a warning to delete
  it if this isn't a proper static egg.  [reinout]

- Fixed readme typos. [seletz]

0.4 (2009-02-18)
================

- Fix to prevent rebuilding lxml all the time, thus reducing the lxml tax. [seletz]

0.3 (2008-12-01)
================

- Only add ``iconv`` on darwin. [seletz]

0.2.1 (2008-11-28)
==================

- Made ``static-build`` default to ``true`` on OS X [seletz]
- Made ``build-libxslt`` and ``build-libxml2`` default to ``true`` [seletz]
- Document default options [seletz]

0.2 (2008-11-27)
================

- Fix Documentation REsT [seletz]
- Rerelease due to setup.cfg messup [seletz]

0.1 (2008-11-27)
================

- Added ``iconv`` library, which enables fully static builds. This is
  actually a bug in lxml's setup. [seletz]
- Updated docs, removed junk code [seletz]
- Added tweaks needed for Mac OS X [seletz]
- Added basic build steps for liblxml2, libxslt and lxml. [seletz]
- Created recipe with ZopeSkel [seletz].
