# Environment Variables
# ---------------------
# Some of the behavior of your Zope/Plone instances are controlled with OS
# environment variables. You may set those here in a key / value format.
# Some common settings:
#    * TZ allows you to set a time zone for systems where it's not
#      automatically available.
#    * zope_i18n_compile_mo_files allows for automatic compilation of
#      missing translation files (may slow startup).
#    * zope_i18n_allowed_languages allows you to limit the available
#      translations.
#    * PYTHON_EGG_CACHE determines where zipped python packages are unpacked
#      for use.
#    * PYTHONHASHSEED determines initial seed for hashes. "random" causes a
#      pseudo-random value is used to seed the hashes of str, bytes and datetime
#      objects.
