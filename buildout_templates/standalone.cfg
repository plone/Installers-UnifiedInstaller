# Buildout Configuration File for Standalone Plone
# ------------------------------------------------
# $LastChangedDate: 2011-07-21 15:20:22 -0700 (Thu, 21 Jul 2011) $ $LastChangedRevision: 51415 $
#
# After making changes in this configuration file,
# you should run bin/buildout to update the components.
# 
# ALWAYS back up all Plone/Zope data and components
# before changing configuration.
# 
# Running "bin/buildout" will update your installation,
# installing missing components as necessary.
# 
# Use "bin/buildout -n" to update many components here to the newest
# available releases.
# This will update the add-on products you've added in the eggs= lines.
# This will not, however, upgrade Plone itself (or anything else you've
# pinned with a version specification). To upgrade Plone itself, see the
# comments in "Plone Component Versions".
#
# Tutorial instructions for using zc.buildout for
# configuration management are available at:
# http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/buildout
# Full details at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout

# Plone Component Versions
# ------------------------
# This version of the Unified Installer has the components
# of Plone  preloaded so that it can install without
# an Internet connection.
# If you want to update, uncomment the "extends = http://..." below,
# edit it to point to the current version URL,
# comment out the "extends = versions.cfg" line
# and run "bin/buildout -n" while attached to the Internet.
# Generally, you only want to do that as part
# of a planned migration.
#
# extends = http://dist.plone.org/release//versions.cfg
extends = versions.cfg
versions = versions

# This extension will dump a list of unpinned versions
# each time you run buildout.
extensions = buildout.dumppickedversions


############################################
# Ports
# -----
# Specify the port on which your Zope installation
# will listen:
http-address = 8080


############################################
# Eggs
# ----
# Add an indented line to the eggs section for any Python
# eggs or packages you wish to include.
#
eggs =
    Plone

# Optional Functionality
# ----------------------
# Uncomment the indented lines to include these products.
# Documentation on all of them, along with many more products,
# is available at
# http://plone.org/products/
#
# Commonly used products:
# * LinguaPlone provides tools for building multi-lingual sites
# * Products.CacheSetup adds the "CacheFu" Plone speedup kit
# * PloneHelpCenter is a simple knowledge base
# * PloneFormGen provides through-the-web form building
#
#    Products.LinguaPlone
#    Products.CacheSetup
#    Products.PloneHelpCenter
#    Products.PloneFormGen
#
# Commonly used development tools:
# * Clouseau uses AJAX to provide a Python prompt inside Plone
# * DocFinderTab puts an object documentation inspector in the Zope Management Interface
# * Gloworm is a Firebug-like viewlet inspector and customizer
# * plone.reload allows you to refresh Python code and ZCML configuration
#   without restarting Zope. Note that to use plone.reload, you'll also
#   need to uncomment the "zcml" entry for it below.
#
#    Products.Clouseau
#    Products.DocFinderTab
#    Products.Gloworm
#    plone.reload

    
############################################
# ZCML Slugs
# ----------
# Some eggs need ZCML slugs to tell Zope to
# use them. Eggs with names beginning with "Products."
# usually don't need this.
zcml =
#    plone.reload

    
############################################
# Development Eggs
# ----------------
# You can use paster to create "development eggs" to
# develop new products/themes. Put these in the src/
# directory.
# You will also need to add the egg names in the
# eggs section above, and may also need to add them
# to the zcml section.
#
# Provide the *paths* to the eggs you are developing here:
develop =
#    src/my.package


############################################
# Debug Mode
# ----------
# Change debug-mode to "on" to run in development mode.
# 
debug-mode = off


############################################
# Backup Directory
# ----------------
# Sets the target directory for the bin/backup and bin/snapshotbackup
# commands. Default is inside this project's var directory, but ideally
# this should be on a separate volume or backup server.
# 
backups-dir=${buildout:directory}/var
