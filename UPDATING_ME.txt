Updating the Unified Installer
==============================

This text is for those wishing to build a new version of the Unified Installer.
It is not meant to help update an installed version of Plone.

If you are working from a git clone you will not have the binary packages. For a good starting point, copy the "packages" subdirectory from a previous installer tarball.

Use a text editor to replace old version with new. Do not auto-replace in HISTORY.txt.

Update the version files:

    cd base_skeleton
    rm *versions.cfg
    ../fetch_versions.py

Run preliminary installs:

    rm ~/Plone
    ./install.sh zeo
    ./install.sh standalone

Expect these builds to fail, as the buildout cache is outdated.

Buildout to update buildout cache:

    cd ~/Plone/zeocluster
    bin/buildout -c develop.cfg
    cd ~/Plone/zinstance
    bin/buildout -c develop.cfg

Make sure these builds succeed.

Update the buildout cache from the new builds:

    cd ~/nui5.0 # or to your installer location
    ./update_packages.py

Sanity check installs:

    rm ~/Plone
    ./install.sh zeo
    ./install.sh standalone

If that fails, there is probably a version regression. Notify the release manager.

Run the tests:

    cd tests
    python testall.py testout.txt

Read the test results. Fix silly problems. Wash and repeat until clean.

Build a new installer:

    ./buildme.sh destination

Upload to Launchpad.
Update release page to link to new installer.
Upload buildout cache to dist.plone.org.

Tag and push.
